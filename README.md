# International Space Station Notifier

This Python script notifies you when the International Space Station (ISS) is passing over your location during nighttime. It utilizes the Open Notify API to get the current ISS position and the Sunrise-Sunset API to determine whether it is currently nighttime at your specified coordinates.

# Prerequisites

# Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:
    Python 3.x
    Requests library (pip install requests)

# Setup
# 1. Clone the repository:
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/iss-notifier.git
     cd iss-notifier
# 2. Install the required dependencies:
     pip install -r requirements.txt
# 3. Update the script with your email credentials and geographical coordinates:
     MY_EMAIL = "your_email@gmail.com"
PASSWORD = "your_email_password"

MY_LAT = 51.507351  # Your latitude
MY_LONG = -0.127758  # Your longitude
